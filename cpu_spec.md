- ISA supported
      - RISC-V
- Pipeline stages
      - 4 stages: IF, DEC, EXE, WB
- Hazard handling (stalls, flushes)
      - Bypassing from EXE and WB to DEC
      - Stall logic implemented
      - Branch prediction is checked in EXE (default assumes PC+4)
      - PackMul implemented outside of ALU. Multiplication in EXE stage and summing in WB stage
- Memory
      - DMC for ICache
      - Two Way associative Cache for Data Cache
- Performance:
      - CPI:
      - tpd: (due to imporvements for MNSIT image recognition application)
